# VoiceActivities Bot
Discord is testing and developing many new voice activities, including the well-known YouTube Together, a Watch2Gether alternative. Since these activities are still under development by Discord, very few people have access to them, but this bot allows the curious among you to use all activities without restrictions and play "Fishing" or "Poker Night" with your friends.
